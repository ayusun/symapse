In the busy schedule of engineering, students generally don’t get much time to learn what is not a part of the curriculum. For that we have different societies in our college. The purpose of this project is to bring the students of two of the most popular societies closer, by providing a one stop platform to share their ideas and knowledge. This project is designed for Konnexions-The IT Society and Qutopia-Quizzing society of KIIT. The members of the group can get to know about the schedule of society meetings, a lot of useful information about related subjects and can also take part in various competitions etc.
